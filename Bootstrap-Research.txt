Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework for creating responsive websites.
It is also mobile oriented and works well on multiple devices. It was developed by
Jacob Thornton and Mark Otto from Twitter. It was released in 2011 as a free, open
source product. By 2014, it became the #1 project on Github.

Using Bootstrap allows you to structure content that will automatically adjust its size
across any screen. It has a collection of syntax prepared for various template designs.
With Bootstrap, an app or web page is able to detect the visitor's device orientation
and screen size. It was designed with smartphones and tablets in mind as the primary user.
